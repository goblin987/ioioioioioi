Phase 1: Verification & Testing
[ ] Verify userbot initialization is working in deployment logs
[ ] Test userbot connection and authentication with Telegram
[ ] Verify secret chat creation functionality works
[ ] Test product delivery through userbot secret chat
[ ] Verify keyword-triggered delivery system works
Phase 2: Fixes & Improvements
[ ] Fix userbot authentication flow if needed
[ ] Implement proper error handling for userbot failures
[ ] Add fallback to bot chat if userbot fails
[ ] Test complete purchase-to-delivery flow
[ ] Add userbot status monitoring and alerts
Phase 3: Production Readiness
[ ] Add userbot reconnection logic
[ ] Implement delivery retry mechanism
[ ] Add delivery confirmation system
[ ] Create admin dashboard for userbot status
[ ] Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
ï¿½ï¿½ Current Issues I Found:
Authentication: The userbot needs to be logged in to Telegram first
Secret Chat API: The current create_secret_chat method may not work as expected
Error Handling: No fallback if userbot fails
Testing: We need to test the actual flow
ðŸ’¡ Better Implementation Approach:
Let me create a more robust implementation based on best practices:
Proper Authentication Flow: Handle login, 2FA, etc.
Reliable Secret Chat Creation: Use proper Telegram API methods
Fallback System: If userbot fails, send to bot chat
Comprehensive Testing: Test each step individually
Would you like me to:
First test the current implementation to see what actually happens?
Create a more robust implementation based on best practices?
Add proper fallback mechanisms so the system works even if userbot fails?
The current code should work, but you're right to be cautious. Let's test it first and then improve it based on what we find!
